Scripting and Automation Repository

Welcome to my scripting and automation repository!

This project is focused on building my skills in bash and PowerShell scripting, 
which are crucial for any tech specialist in the industry.

As a future cyber professional, I have created this repository to practice and learn the fundamentals of scripting and automate tedious tasks on various systems.
