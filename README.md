Scripting and Automation Repository
Welcome to my scripting and automation repository! This project is focused on building my skills in bash and PowerShell scripting, 
which are crucial for any tech specialist in the industry. 
As a future cyber professional, I have created this repository to practice and learn the fundamentals of scripting and automate tedious tasks on various systems.

Key Concepts Explored

Throughout this project, I have explored and tested several fundamental concepts, including:

Printing Text: Learn how to display messages and information on the command line interface or console.
User Interaction and Data Storage: Understand how to interact with users, capture their input, and store the provided data in memory for further use.
Variables: Gain proficiency in working with variables to store and manipulate data within scripts.
Functions: Master the usage of functions, allowing for modular and reusable blocks of code to perform specific tasks.
Arrays: Explore the power of arrays, enabling the storage and manipulation of multiple values under a single variable, such as creating directories and files dynamically.
Loops: Develop skills in utilizing loops to iterate over arrays, perform repetitive tasks, or control program flow efficiently.
Conditionals: Learn to make decisions within scripts using conditionals, enabling different code execution paths based on specific conditions.
System Information Retrieval: Discover techniques for retrieving system information using commands such as LSHW in bash or PowerShell commands.
Automation: Develop automation scripts to streamline repetitive or tedious tasks, including examples like automating copy operations using ROBOCOPY or configuring new Windows 10 endpoints.
PowerShell Commands: Learn a variety of PowerShell commands (cmdlets) to manage processes, fetch system event logs, retrieve information about running, open, and closed processes.
Filtering and Searching: Utilize PowerShell cmdlets like Select-String to filter script outputs and search for specific text patterns within files or folders.
Domain Information Retrieval: Fetch domain-related information using commands like whois, dig, host, nslookup, and employ variables and functions for enhanced functionality.

By exploring these concepts, I aim to enhance my scripting and automation skills, enabling me to excel in my future cyber professional career.
