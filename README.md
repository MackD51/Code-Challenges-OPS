Scripting and Automation Repository

Welcome to my scripting and automation repository! 
This project is focused on building my skills in bash and PowerShell scripting, which are crucial for any tech specialist in the industry. 

As a future cyber professional, I have created this repository to practice and learn the fundamentals of scripting and automate tedious tasks on various systems.

Key Concepts Explored

Throughout this project, I have explored and tested several fundamental concepts, including:

Printing Text: Learn how to display messages and information on the command line interface.

User Interaction and Data Storage: Understand how to interact with users, capture their input, and store the provided data in memory for further use.

Variables: Gain proficiency in working with variables to store and manipulate data within scripts.

Functions: Practice the usage of functions, allowing for reusable blocks of code to perform specific tasks, such as printing the login history of users.

Arrays: Explore the power of arrays, enabling the storage and manipulation of multiple values under a single variable, such as creating directories and files dynamically.

Loops: Develop skills in utilizing loops to iterate over arrays and perform repetitive tasks, such as displaying and stopping processes.

Conditionals: Learn to make decisions within scripts using conditionals, enabling different code execution paths based on specific conditions, such as checking it a file exists and creating a new file if it does not.

System Information Retrieval: Discover techniques for retrieving system information using commands such as LSHW.

Automation: Develop automation scripts to streamline repetitive or tedious tasks, including examples like automating copy operations using ROBOCOPY or configuring new Windows 10 endpoints.

PowerShell Commands: Learn a variety of PowerShell commands (cmdlets) to manage processes, fetch system event logs, retrieve information about running processes, and open, and close processes.

Filtering and Searching: Utilize PowerShell cmdlets like Select-String to filter script outputs and search for specific text patterns within files or folders.

Domain Information Retrieval: Fetch domain-related information using commands like whois, dig, host, nslookup, and employ variables and functions for enhanced functionality.

By exploring these concepts, I aim to enhance my scripting and automation skills, enabling me to excel in my future cyber professional career.
